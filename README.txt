DESCRIPTION
DotDash is a morse code messaging service. Users can type out messages in morse code and send them via SMS, as well as playback received messages in morse code with vibration. All this may be done in either the full mode or "pocket" mode which is intended to be used without having to look at the phone.

POCKET MODE OPERATION
Pocket Mode can be used to send and receive morse messages from your pocket. In the main screen, the top button will play back any unread messages in the order they were received. Tap a contact's ID into the bottom button to start composing a message to that contact. In the compose screen, simply tap out the message. To send the message, press and hold the screen for about 3 seconds. There will be a warning vibration and two message sent vibrations.


STATUS
Current issues:
    1. Receiveing messages when DotDash is completely closed (not just running in the background) causes DotDash to crash.


INSTALL NOTES
DotDash cannot send or receive messages from the emulator because it requires a phone number. Other than that, simply clone, build, and install DotDash to get morse-ing!
